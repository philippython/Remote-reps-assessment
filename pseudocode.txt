Key Steps:
1. Track Daily and Monthly Spend:
   - At the end of each ad spend update, check if a brand has exceeded its daily or monthly budget.

2. Turn Off Campaigns When Budgets Are Reached:
   - If a brand exceeds its daily budget, disable all its campaigns for the rest of the day.
   - If a brand exceeds its monthly budget, disable all its campaigns for the rest of the month.

3. Respect Dayparting:
   - Check if the current time falls within allowed dayparting hours before enabling a campaign.

4. Reset Budgets at the Start of a New Day/Month:
   - At midnight, reset daily spend for all brands.
   - On the first day of a new month, reset monthly spend for all brands.

5. Re-enable Campaigns When Allowed:
   - If the daily/monthly budget allows, campaigns can be turned back on.
